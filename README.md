# Language
When talking about the features of the XMTP protocol, these are the specific terms to use:

- Open-source
- Censorship resistant
- Quantum resistant
- No private server

The XMTP protocol brings the same security gurantees as Signal and both are audited by the same firm.

## Integration Language
When implementing the XMTP protocol or referencing the protocol in language, it should read as:

*Secured by XMTP*

# Logo Construction
The distance between the x and the inside part of the swoop is one unit (1x). This is used to create the same space between the letters in the wordmark. The XMTP is 1.5x away from the x mark. The space outside of the logomark is 3x (top and bottom, left and right).

# Terminology
The logo is the symbolic x mark, accompanied with the wordmark. Together, this makes the logotype.

# X-Mark Construction
The X-Mark serves as the center piece of the logo. The bottom right part of the x extends and connects to the circular path going up and around, ending in a swoop.
